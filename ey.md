**PART 2: Suggested Upskilling Path**

1. ► Strengthen Front-End Proficiency  
   - Expand knowledge of JavaScript and modern frameworks (e.g., React, Vue).  
   - Practice building fully functional prototypes that integrate with real data or APIs.

2. ► Solidify Architect-Level Thinking  
   - Explore advanced topics in information architecture, design systems, and cross-device consistency.  
   - Study platform-specific guidelines (Material Design, Human Interface Guidelines) to handle complex UI scenarios.

3. ► Deepen Design Operations & Leadership  
   - Seek opportunities to plan, strategize, and direct design activities, even on small internal projects.  
   - Focus on documentation, style guides, and ensuring that design standards remain consistent across teams.

4. ► Advanced Testing & Accessibility  
   - Incorporate automated or AI-driven usability tests (e.g., A/B tests) into your design cycles.  
   - Thoroughly study accessibility standards (WCAG) and inclusive design approaches.

5. ► Collaboration & Cross-Functional Communication  
   - Partner with developers on open-source projects to gain practical insights into the feasibility of designs.  
   - Practice presenting complex UX/UI concepts to stakeholders in concise, results-driven narratives.

By following these recommendations, you can transition towards a UX/UI Engineer or Architect role—one that requires both technical fluency and high-level design leadership.
